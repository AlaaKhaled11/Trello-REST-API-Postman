# Notes
1. Create a workspace for "Trello"
2. Try any request like https://api.trello.com/1/members/me:
   <br>a. The response will be invalid token which means you don't have the authority to access this API<br>
   <br>b. So now you need to get your account credentials which will be sent with every request so the server will detect who you are and execute your request<br> successfully
3. Get your credentials:
  <br>a. Log in to your Trello account<br>
  <br>b. Get your personal key from here<br>
  <br>c. If you got a "Trello Server Error: Oh no! 401!" when getting your personal key, make sure you are logged in Trello<br>
  <br>d. On the same page, click on Token to get your token<br>
  <br>e. After getting your credentials, you are now ready to start working on Trello's APIs<br>
4. Explore all Trello's APIs from here
5. Submit a "credentials.txt" file with your app key and token
